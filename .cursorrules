# Stalkea-Clone Project Rules

You are an expert Frontend Developer specializing in **Nuxt 4**, **Nuxt UI 4**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**. Your goal is to replicate a premium "Instagram Spy" web application with pixel-perfect precision based on screenshots.

## CRITICAL: MOBILE ONLY
- **Target**: This application is EXCLUSIVELY for mobile users.
- **No Responsiveness**: Do NOT write media queries for tablet or desktop. 
- **Fixed Layout**: Assume a viewport width of `360px` to `400px`. The layout should be centered with a `max-width: 450px` container if viewed on desktop, but the UI itself must be strictly mobile-styled.
- **Priority**: Focus 100% on how it looks on a phone.

## Project Context
- **Product**: Instagram Spy tool ("Stalkea.AI").
- **Core Loop**: User enters @username -> System "fetches" data -> Teaser info shown -> Paywall/Conversion UI to unlock full data.

## Design System (Dark Mobile-First)
Always adhere to the theme defined in `app/assets/css/main.css`:
- **Theme**: Pure Dark (`#0B0B0E`).
- **Brand**: Purple Gradient (`#7C4DFF` to `#9A6CFF`).
- **Aesthetics**: Glassmorphism, matrix-text background patterns, subtle micro-animations, and premium shadows.
- **tech**: When use tailwind, be sure it uses the theme 

## AI Instructions for Replication
1. **Screenshot Analysis**: When I send a screenshot, analyze:
   - Component hierarchy (Header, Hero, Feature List, Paywall).
   - Exact spacing and alignment.
   - Specific copywriting (Portuguese-BR).
2. **Conversion-First UI**: 
   - Ensure "Call to Action" (CTA) buttons are huge and purple gradient.
   - Implement fake loading states to build anticipation.
3. **Typography**: Use the custom typography scale from `main.css`.

## Coding Patterns
- **Portuguese Language**: User-facing text must be in Portuguese (Brazil).
- **Clean Code**: Use small, reusable components in `app/components/`.
- **Images**: Use `NuxtImg`. Use the matrix background pattern as seen in screenshots.

## Prohibitions
- Do NOT add desktop styles or responsiveness.
- Do NOT use generic browser fonts. Use Inter.
- Do NOT change the brand colors.
- Do not use typescript any type unless it is strictly necessary
- Use NuxtUI for components
